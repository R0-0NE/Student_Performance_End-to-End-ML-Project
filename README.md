## Student Performance Prediction
An end-to-end machine learning project that predicts student performance based on various academic and demographic factors. This project covers the entire ML lifecycle, including data ingestion, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment.

### Project Overview
The Student Performance Prediction project aims to analyze and predict students' academic performance. Using historical data, we trained several machine learning models to determine the impact of different features on student outcomes. The project includes automated data pipelines, model tracking with MLflow, and version control with DVC.

### Features
Data Ingestion and Cleaning: Reads raw data, cleans missing values, and performs feature engineering.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Detailed insights into data trends and correlations.
Model Training: Multiple algorithms, including CatBoost, for robust performance.
Performance Tracking: Tracks model experiments with MLflow.
Version Control: Manages data and models with DVC.
Deployment: Dockerized app for easy deployment on cloud platforms
